Collection of scripts for GreaseMonkey. All my scripts are only tested in the latest version of Firefox.
If you want to make improvements I'm open to pull requests. Use these at your own risk.

  **Youtube Music "Like all in playlist"**
  
  This script adds an extra button to the top of the playlist in Youtube Music. If you click it, all songs in
  the playlist are added to your liked songs.
  
  **Note**: there is no way back! Depending on the size of the playlist and your cpu power the action might take
  a long time to run, block your browser or not complete. I have used it successfully on playlists of 100+
  songs.
